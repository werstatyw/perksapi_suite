In this project I will cover main api calls with simple tests. If it'll work normally and will be easy to maintain - we will cover all perks api calls.

1. The project consists of 2 main parts: python scripts with a functions inside. They are based on api requiests from postman on perks (requests framework). For this fuctions created a test function inside test folder.
2. the installtion works when running make all - this include linting, formating and running all the tests in "test" directory
3. additonally i've created a config file (scriptconfig.py) where i'll put repeated script settings.
